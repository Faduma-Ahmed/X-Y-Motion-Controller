 #### Workflow 
 
 - Feasiblity Model : refined and tested our initial design ideas against functional requirements.
 
 - Schematic Design: use EDA tool, diptrace in order to intergrate our actuators & sensors into a single circuit
 - PCB Design: used CAD tool to realize our schematic onto a PCB layout
 - PCB Assembly: soldered modules onto our fabricated board, finished programming MCU
